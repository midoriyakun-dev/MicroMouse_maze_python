# MicroMouse_maze_python

Make a Database and a GUI for visualizing the algorithms ,maybe need some unique random pattern generator for generating the 5*5? maze//refer to comp web page.Then need some comp selector maybe I can make an AI algo using Compvision which takes a corner height map of the maze and find the shortest and fastest route on the first go make the training processes on the go? or use pre trained model? maybe take some inference from the web and already developed open source code bases. 

Replicate different algorithms for Micro mouse comp , like DFS,BFS, floodfill ,and a visualizer
